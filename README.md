TinyGpsPlus_SparkCore
=================

This library is derrived from the TinyGps++ library by Mikal Hart.  It has beenported for functionality on Spark Core Device.
NOTE:
Disabled 'distanceBetween' and 'courseTo' functions.

TinyGPS++ is a new Arduino library for parsing NMEA data streams provided by GPS modules.
Like its predecessor, TinyGPS, this library provides compact and easy-to-use methods for extracting position, date, time, altitude, speed, and course from consumer GPS devices. 
However, TinyGPS++â€™s programmer interface is considerably simpler to use than TinyGPS, and the new library can extract arbitrary data from any of the myriad NMEA sentences out there, even proprietary ones.
